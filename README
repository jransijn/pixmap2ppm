PIXMAP2PPM

    `pixmap2ppm` is a simple program for visualizing the image data of pixmaps
    stored on the X11 server.

EXAMPLE - SAVE WALLPAPER

    To get a ppm of the wallpaper of your X server, execute:

        $ pixmap2ppm -o wallpaper.ppm 0x4a00001

    Where `0x4a00001` is the value of a property on the root window with one
    of these names:

      - _XROOTPMAP_ID
      - ESETROOT_PMAP_ID
      - _XSETROOT_ID

    If you have it installed, you can get this value with the `xprop` program:

        $ xprop -root _XROOTPMAP_ID

EXAMPLE - MAKE SCREENSHOT

    To get a ppm of your current root window (a 'screenshot'), execute:

        $ pixmap2ppm -o screenshot.ppm 0x1d9

    Where `0x1d9` is the XID of the root window.

    You can use the `xwininfo` program to find the root window XID:

        $ xwininfo -root
